Balram4, where it is held that the proper approach should be to see whether relevant data and material referred to in the report of the Commission justify its conclusions. As far as the individual provisions are concerned, the learned senior counsel has mounted his attack on Section 4 of the impugned Act being violative of Articles 13, 32, 226 and 227. Further, according to the learned senior counsel, the contradictory provisions of the impugned Act are evidenced from plain reading of Sections, 2, 3 and 5 on one hand, for the purpose of providing reservation the legislature seeks to extend the benefits available to SC/ST and OBC vis-a-vis the creamy layer distinction. However, for the purpose of section 5, the legislature seeks to hold SEBC Maratha community as a separate and distinct from OBC. Thus, according to the learned counsel, the State legislature has chosen to approbate and reprobate by framing provisions to only selectively benefits the Maratha community. He would also further assert that Section 2(j) which defines the term 'SEBC' is also violating the essence of Article 14 as the legislature is attempting to create a class of Marathas within the already existing class of 4 1972 (1) scc 660 patil-sachin.

4,"It is not disputed before us that the requisite ceremonies for a valid marriage under the personal law of the parties have been gone into in this case, although the marriage is null and void by reason of the provisions of sections 5 and 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. This Act was passed with the object of amending and modifying the law relating to marriages among Hindus. Under the customary law, there was no restriction for a male Hindu to marry more than one women. This right of the Hindu husband under the customary Hindu Law was curtailed for the first time in the then Bombay Province by enacting the Bombay Prevention of Hindu Bigamous Marriage Act, 1946, provisions whereof declared bigamy to be illegal. Under the provisions of the said Act and other similar laws enacted by other Provincial Legislatures, a second marriage by a Hindu person during the life time of the spouse was declared illegal and going through such a marriage was made penal. Consistent with the object of codifying the marriage laws amongst Hindus, all these State laws were repealed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act provides for the conditions for solemnisation of marriage between any two Hindus. Section 11 declares that a marriage solemnised after the commencement of the Act shall be null and void if it contravenes any of conditions specified in Clause (i), (iv) and (v) of section 5. One of the conditions for a marriage as required by section 5 is that neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage, and this is condition No. (i) in section 5. Section 11 also gives a remedy to either party to the marriage to file a petition for a declaration by a decree of nullity of marriage on any one of the said three conditions of section 5 being shown to the have been contravened. Obviously, the second marriage in such circumstances being void, it cannot create a legal status of husband and wife between the parties. It is true that section 11 also gives a right to the parties to the marriage to file a petition for a declaration of nullity by a decree of the Court , but the filing of the petition or passing the decree is not a condition precedent for putting an end to the marriage. What ultimately is declared on such a petition is nothing but the status of the party as on the date of the marriage, and therefore, the marriage does not continue to remain valid until a decree is passed. What is null and void cannot be deemed to be in existence for any purposes whatsoever. Under the circumstances, if a marriage is solemnised in contravention of any of the said three conditions referred to in section 5(i), the woman cannot get the status of the wife nor the male gets the status of a husband qua her. The second marriage does not continue to be valid till the passing of the decree for a nullity. The position is also clear from the fact that bigamy is made penal by section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act which provides that any marriage between two Hindu solemnised after the commencement of this Act is void if at the date of such marriage either party had a husband or wife living and the provisions of sections 494 and 495 of the Indian Penal Code shall apply accordingly. The position is made further clear from the anxiety of the legislature to protect children of such a marriage by providing in section 16 that not withstanding that a marriage is null and void under section 11, any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act. However, the rights of such a child are somewhat curtailed in the matter of inheritance to the property, because sub-section (3) of section 16 says that a child of such a marriage would not be entitled to any rights in or to the property of any person other than the parents. Having regard to all these provisions, the marriage of the petitioner with the respondent was void ab initio and the respondent could not get the status of a legally wedded wife inspite of the solemnisation of the marriage under the Hindu Law having gone into. Indeed, Mr. Gavnekar did not dispute this legal position. He, however, contended that the provisions of section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act conferred a right of maintenance on the second wife and the word ""wife"" in section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will have to be given a wider meaning as including a Hindu wife whose marriage may be otherwise void.",['5' '11' '16' '17' '3' '16' '25']

7,"In the judgment in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar (supra) it is seen that the Will was dated 16.7.1950 and under the Will the property which was given to the widow was to provide for the maintenance of the widow. In spite of the fact that the Will in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar (supra) gave the property towards maintenance yet the Supreme Court held that the property which was given for maintenance by such wording of the Will, however the property given as a life-estate has to be taken as being given towards a pre-existing right of maintenance which existed under the shastric law and/or Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act and therefore the property given as life-interest for maintenance would be converted into a full ownership. In para 12 of the judgment in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar (supra) reference is made to the judgment in the case of Gumpha (supra) and it is observed that judgment in the case of Gumpha (supra) proceeded on the basis that the right of a Hindu male to dispose of his property is absolute and therefore there is a right to create a limited/restricted estate/life-estate in favour of a female but however if the right to maintenance can be read as being given in recognition of pre-existing rights as per C. Masilamani Mudaliar's case (supra), then the property given for maintenance would be taken out of Section 14(2) and would be included under Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act. Para 26 of the judgment in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar's (supra) holds that when interpretations have to be given to the provision of a statute then the same should be in conformity with the constitutional goals to remove any handicap or discrimination against a Hindu female and all that was required for a property which is given as a life-estate to a Hindu female for becoming a full owner thereof was that the Hindu female must be found to have a pre-existing right either under the personal law or any other law of the country and that this personal law or other law would include right to maintenance under the law of the country which is the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. This is so categorically clarified in the very first line of para 29 of the said judgment where it is specified that the widow in C. Masilamani Mudaliar's case (supra) had a pre-existing right to maintenance under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act when the property was given to her for maintenance. I would like to note that the provision of Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act which is not stated in para 29 is the provision of Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act which gives right to the wife for maintenance from the property of her husband. Second line of para 29 of the judgment in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar's (supra) lays down a specific ratio that once there is a pre-existing right of a Hindu wife to maintenance because of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, then because of this reason the property given to the Hindu female has to be taken in lieu of her pre-existing right to maintenance and therefore the property given under the Will for a limited right of a life- estate, the life-estate will blossom into full ownership because of Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act. Referring to para 28 of the judgment in the case of Gumpha (supra) in the later para 29 of the judgment in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar (supra), the Supreme Court has observed in the case of C. Masilamani Mudaliar (supra) that the restrictive interpretation put by the Bench of two Judges in the case of Gumpha (supra) that the life-estate will remain a life-estate is not sound in law and the Division Bench in the case of Gumpha (supra) did not approach the problem from a correct prospective by interpreting right of life-estate given under the Will only as a life-estate and not to have become a full ownership which it should be as per Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act. In para 29 by referring to V. Tulasamma and Others Vs. Sesha Reddy (Dead) by Lr's (1977) 3 SCC 99, it is observed that a right acquired under a Will can be because of pre-existing right of maintenance under the shastric law, and once that pre-existing right to maintenance exists, under the shastric law then because of Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act the restrictive estate given under the shastric law is wiped out and the widow becomes absolute owner of the property. The judgment in the case of Gumpha (supra) was therefore set aside by holding that what is required to be seen is not the language of the Will as to whether by the Will a Hindu husband gave the property to the wife as a life-estate or for maintenance but the issue was whether what is given as a life-estate or maintenance to the widow/wife is or is not because of a pre-existing right, and that since a pre-existing right clearly exists either under a shastric law or under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, and once there does exist a pre-existing right for a life-estate to be created or for maintenance to be given, then the limited interest/life-interest/life-estate will get converted into the full ownership because of Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act which specifically lays down that once there is a pre-existing right then what is given pursuant to a document being a Will would not result in a restrictive estate but the life-estate would become a full ownership",['14' '18']
8,"It is therefore seen that in Gumpha's case (supra) there was a Will executed in favour of the widow which specifically gave only a life-estate. Supreme Court held in Gumpha's case (supra) that the life-interest/life-estate in favour of a widow did not convert the life-interest/life-estate into a full ownership because by a Will a Hindu male had a right to give restricted ownership in his property to his widow. Supreme Court has in para 9 in Gumpha's case (supra) specifically held that legislature was aware of the unrestricted power of the Hindu male to dispose of his property and which is recognized as Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act and therefore such right to give full estate by a Hindu male cannot be curtailed by converting the life-estate into full estate and the Will granting the life-estate has to be taken as a document/instrument which is covered under Section 14(2) and not Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act. In para 12 of the judgment in Gumpha's case (supra) Supreme Court has observed that a Hindu can bequeath his interest even in a joint property and the effect on the right of the widow of the testator given as life-estate for maintenance is for maintenance and not in lieu of maintenance i.e life-estate is given for maintenance and not in lieu of maintenance, and consequently the life-estate granted to the widow falls under Section 14(2) and not under Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act.

9,"With great respect, we are afraid this may not be the proper construction of Section 29 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act Section 29 (2) did not operate to incorporate into the Hindu Marriage Act any provision of the Nair Act or any right recognised thereunder. That section only limited the operation of the provisions of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act (for that matter other provisions too) to cases other than those contemplated by Section 29 (2) of the Act, cases in which, as we have said earlier, provisions had been made ia the special enactments. The provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act would not apply to such cases by reason of Section 29 (2). That provision cannot be read as incorporating any provision of or right under the special enactment into the Hindu Marriage Act. The learned Judge further finds-",['29']
10,"The express provision in the sub-section would save the rights recognised by custom conferred by any special enactment to obtain the dissolution of Hindu marriage. Therefore if there was a special enactment in force which conferred a right to obtain dissolution, the provision with regard to dissolution of marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act would not affect such right. The field of operation of the right to dissolution conferred under the Hindu Marriage Act was restricted in its scope by reason of Section 29 (2) of the Act. It was operative in all cases other than those to which Section 29 (2) would apply. In other words the right to obtain dissolution under the Hindu Marriage Act did not extend to cases where provision has been made for that purpose in special enactments. In such cases the special enactment would continue to operate. The words ""nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to affect any right"" in Sub-section (2) of Section 29 of the Act clearly indicate the limited scope of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, limited in the sense that it will not override the provisions in special enactments conferring right to obtain dissolution of Hindu marriage. In that view the provisions of the Nair Act which conferred a right to obtain dissolution of marriage on certain specific grounds and by resort to a specific procedure would remain in force not because such right was conferred by Section 29 (2) but Section 29 (2) limits the operation of Section 13 to cases other than those covered, among other laws by Nair Act 1100. In that view Section 4 (b) will not be applicable, for, that renders any law inoperative only in so far as it is inconsistent with any provision contained in the Act. Nair Act is not inconsistent with any provision contained in the Hindu Marriage Act, for, Section 13 limited in its operation to cases other than those covered by Section 29 (2) would not be inconsistent with cases covered by Section 29 (2). In other words the provisions of Nair Act concerning the right to obtain dissolution of marriage are not inconsistent with Section 13 of the Act.",['29' '2' '4' '13']
11,"After the passing of the Hindu Succession Act, by virtue of Section 14 of that Act, a widow gets an absolute interest in her deceased husband's property possessed by her. If Section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Re-marriage Act was to apply to cases where a Hindu widow has got an absolute interest in her deceased husband's property, that will be inconsistent with the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act and, therefore, invalid to the extent of inconsistency by virtue of the provisions of Section 4 (l) (b) of the Hindu Succession Act. Learned Counsel for the appellant placed reliance on Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act, according to which, in absence of the heirs expressly mentioned in Clause (a) of Sub-section (11. the property inherited by a female Hindu from her father or mother was on her dying intestate to devolve on the heirs of her father while the property inherited by a female Hindu from her husband was to devolve upon the heirs of the husband. According to him, this showed that the intention of the makers of the Hindu Succession Act was that the property in the hands of a Hindu female should not go out of the hands of the branch to which it originally belonged. Section 15 applies only to cases where a female Hindu dies intestate",['2' '4' '11' '14' '15']
12,"I am in entire agreement with my learned Brother Mukharji, J. that Section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Re-marriage Act is inconsistent with Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, and, therefore, in cases, where a Hindu widow gets absolute right by inrcritanee in her husband's property, she cannot be divested of that right by virtue of Section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Re-marriage Act. In my opinion, Section 2 aforesaid merely divests a Hindu widow on re-marriage of limited interest held by her. It has been expressly so stated with regard to her husband's property coming to her by virtue of any Will or testamentary disposition. If the interest conferred upon her in her husband's property by virtue of will or testamentary disposition is not limited but absolute, the section has got no application. It appears that the section has also got no application where she gets her deceased husband's property by virtue of a non-testamentary disposition. Rights and interest acquired by her in her husband's property by inheritance, to her husband or to his lineal successors were limited interest before the passing of the Hindu Succession Act.",['2' '14']

16,"The difficulty arises because the word ""fraud"" is not defined in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. But in my opinion, the provisions of Section 17 of the Indian Contract Act cannot apply to fraud as understood in Section 12(1)(c) of the Hindu Marriage Act. It is necessary to bear in mind that there is a difference between the marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 and the marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The Special marriage Act, 1954 provides a special form of marriage in certain cases. It is permissible to a Hindu, by virtue of this Act, to have his marriage with another Hindu or a person belonging to any other community solemnized in accordance with the requirements of the Act: The rights, obligations and status of the parties to such civil marriage in matters relating to restitution of conjugal rights, judicial separation, nullity of marriage and divorce are regulated by the provisions contained in that Act. The succession to property of two Hindus married under that Act as also to the property of the issues of such marriage is governed by the relevant provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 and not by the Hindu Law of succession. It is significant to notice that no ceremonies are necessary for the marriage being valid under that Act. Obviously, therefore, the marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, is a contract. The position under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, however, is different. It is needless to say that marriage under the Hindu Law is treated as a samskara or a sacrament. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, contemplates a ceremonial marriage which must be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of one of the two parties. Non-observance of the essential customary rites and ceremonies of at least one of the parties would amount to failure to solemnize the marriage. In other words, a marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act which is not solemnized by performance of the essential ceremonies is, under the Act, no marriage at all: It is true that the conditions laid down in Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act must also be fulfilled before a marriage under that Act is gone through. But the non-fulfilment of every one of the conditions and requirements enacted in Section 5 does not ipso facto render the marriage null and void or even voidable: It seems to me, therefore, that under the Hindu Marriage Act, the marriage which is a ceremonial marriage which is a ceremonial marriage is essentially a sacrament (Samskara).",['5' '12' '17']
17,"The learned Judge of the original Court referring to Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act held that the conditions of that section for invoking the jurisdiction of his Court were not satisfied inasmuch as neither was the marriage solemnised within the jurisdiction of his Court, nor was it the case that the husband and wife resided or last resided together within the jurisdiction of his Court. It was claimed before the learned Judge that even if conditions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act were not complied with, in the instant case the Court would have jurisdiction under Section 20, Civil Procedure Code, which was expressly made applicable to proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act by Section 21.",['19' '20' '21']
18,"The applicant has new come up to this Court and has reiterated the same contentions. It is undoubtedly a somewhat peculiar case. The Hindu Marriage Act was passed by Parliament in 1955 and became the law on 18th May 1955. Under the Act certain rights have been for the first time created in favour of Hindu spouses who are citizens of this country. One of those rights is for husband or wife to obtain a decree for divorce in respect of marriage solemnised even before the commencement of this Act if one or the other of the conditions in Section 13 of the Act are satisfied. The question is whether the enforcement of this right which has been created by the Hindu Marriage Act, can be defeated or denied to a Hindu, who is otherwise entitled to it, by an interpretation put on Section 19 of the Act which makes the remedies available under the Act nugatory so far as Hindus whose marriages were solemnised in a territory which was previously a part of India but is now a part of Pakistan and who have separated before the partition, are concerned. If the provisions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act are to be interpreted in such a manner, then the only result would be that any person in the position of the applicant and the opponent in the instant case would not he entitled to avail of any of the rights or remedies created in respect of spouses, husbands or wives, under the Act, whether the marriages were solemnised before cr even after the Act. In my opinion, that could not be the intention of the law, and in particular, of the provision regarding jurisdiction of the Court created under Section 19 of the Act. It is in this context that the provisions of Section 21, which make applicable the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure to the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, have to be interpreted. It is undoubtedly true that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code have been made applicable subject to the provisions of the Act contained therein. Therefore, the proper way of reconciling the provisions of Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act with the provision as to the right of suing to be found in the relevant provisions of the Cods of Civil Procedure, and in particular, Section 20 of the Code, would be first to see whether the jurisdiction can be invoked by satisfaction of any of the conditions of Section 19 of the Act. If the provisions of Section 19 of the Act had been called into play, then in that case it is those provisions which must be satisfied if they are capable of being satisfied in a particular case.

Under Section 28(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act the period of limitation is prescribed for orders passed under the Hindu Marriage Act. In this view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the stipulation of Section 19(3) are more general in nature inasmuch as they cover not 12 of 23 13 cam.448.14.doc only orders passed by the Family Court under the Hindu Marriage Act but cover all appealable orders passed in proceedings before the Family Court.

20,"Section 14 of the Divorce Act also, in my view, goes a long way to indicate that court cannot, and at any rate, should not decree dissolution solely on the statements made in the petition, event though Section 47 makes them referable as evidence. Section 14 provides that a Court in order to decree dissolution must not only be ""satisfied on the evidence that the case of the petitioner has been proved"", but must also be satisfied that the petition is not presented or prosecuted in collusion with the respondent and that the petitioner has not in any manner been accessory to or conniving at or condoned the adultery complained of. I have no doubt that no court can reasonably come to these findings merely on the statements in the petition without examining the petitioner, more particularly in an undefended case and I would like to refer to the single Judge decision of the Allahabad High Court in Anjula v. Milan , where the learned Judge has taken similar view while considering Section 20(2) and Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act, analogous to Section 47 and Section 14, respectively, of the Divorce Act I am, therefore, of the view that I cannot, and, at any rate, could not confirm the decree on the basis of the statements made in the petition, even assuming that these statements, if believed, would have reasonably proved the alleged adultery. I must, however, note that my Lord Mookherjee, J., has indicated during our discussion that the view that no decree can ever be founded on the statements in the petition may be too broad a proposition and that there may be appropriate cases where such statement may form part of the basis for a decree.",['14' '20' '23']
21,"The first contention that has been made on behalf of the appellant is that by virtue of the provisions of Section 21 of the HinduMarriage Act the Code of Civil Procedure is made applicable toproceedings under the said Act and so, even if the petition wasnot maintainable under Section 19 of the Act it should have been heldthat the District Court in Delhi had jurisdiction to entertain the petitionby virtue of the provisions of Section 20 of the Code of Civil ProcedureThe contention is since the cause of action or a part of the cause ofaction, viz. the failure of the wife to discharge her marital obligationsto the husband at the place where the husband resides, arises at Delhi,the appellant being a permanent resident of Delhi, it should havebeen held that the Courts at Delhi have jurisdiction to entertain THE petition. Of this contention there were two facets. First, that byvirtue of Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act Section 20 of theCode of Civil Procedure stands incorporated in the said Act, andsecondly, the petition under Section 9 of the Act was a compositepetition or suit and could be treated cither as a petition under theHindu Marriage Act simplicitor or a suit under Section 9 of the Codeof Civil Procedure.",['19' '20' '21' '9']

It is true that Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 deals with reference to the custody, maintenance and education of minor children. However, in our view, at least prima facie, the said Section cannot be read in isolation. Section 20 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, Pg 9 of 20 reserved.cam.25.2017 (Colabawalla).april.18.doc 1956 clearly stipulates that, subject to the provisions of this section, a Hindu is bound, during his or her lifetime, to maintain his or her legitimate or illegitimate children and his or her aged or infirm parents.

But in the case of a spouse like the petitioner, who cannot satisfy the condition of Section 19, the residuary remedy that is made available to the petitioner by application of the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code in general, and in particular, of Section 20 regarding the place of suing, must be made available to a litigant for relief under the Hindu Marriage Act. In this aspect of the case, In my opinion, the view taken by the Courts below is not sustainable and the denial of jurisdiction by the first Court will not be justified.",['19' '20']
25,"In our view, on proper construction of the relevant provisions it is not possible to uphold the preliminary objection. In the first place it is difficult to accept the contention that the substantive provision contained in s. 25 C.P.C. is excluded by reason of s. 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act merely provides: ""Subject to other provisions contained in this Act and to such rules as the High Court may make in that behalf, all proceedings under this Act shall be regulated, as far as may be, by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908"". In terms s. 21 does not make any distinction between procedural and substantive provisions of C.P.C. and all that it provides is that the Code as far as may be shall apply to all proceedings under the Act and the phrase ""as far as may be"" means and is intended to exclude only such provisions of the Code as are or may be inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Act. It is impossible to say that such provisions of the Code as partake of the character of substantive law are excluded by implication as no such implication can be read into s. 21 and a particular provision of the Code irrespective of whether it is procedural or substantive will not apply only if it is inconsistent with any provision of the Act. For instance, it is difficult to countenance the suggestion that the doctrine of res judicata contained in s. 11 of the Code which partakes of the character of substantive law is not applicable to proceedings under the Act. Res judicata, after all, is a branch or specie of the Rule of Estoppel called Estoppel by Record and though Estoppel is often described as a rule of evidence, the whole concept is more correctly viewed as a substantive rule of law (See: Canada and Dominion Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships Ltd.",['21']
26,"Section 21 of the Hindu Marriage Act does not as such provide for any discretion to be exercised by the Court in the matter of transfer. However, by the introduction of Section 21A, specific provision has been made to deal with a situation where one party has filed a petition before one Court and the other party has filed a petition for a similar relief in the other Court. However, the application of Section 21A is restricted to a petition under Section 10 or a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. But Section 21A is not exhaustive in the matter of transfer of cases. Section 21A does not cover the several situations warranting transfer of one case to the other Court either for simultaneous disposal or for joint trial. These situations are covered by Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The special provision, namely, Section 21A of the Hindu Marriage Act, would not curtail the general power of the Court contained in Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

On the other hand, the learned counsel Shri B. M.

All that we have said hereinbefore is that we can not decree divorce solely on the basis of compromise unless we are also satisfied that a ground for divorce specified in the Statute can be traced on the record In the case at hand it is on record that the parties have fought with severest bellicosity in the Courts below for about two years, the charge of the husband being mental disorder of the wife and that of the wife being cruelty and physical tenure by the husband. Having lost at the first bout in the trial Court, the husband has filed this appeal and the parties were contesting the same with all severity for about two years in this Court. They are living separately during all these years and both of them have sworn in their joint-affidavit that they have not been nor would be able to live together. To the same effect is their statement before us when we directed them to appear before us in the Chamber to ascertain the truth of their averments made in the joint-application. If the spouses could not live together, do not live together and they swear that they would no longer live or able to live together, then we have no doubt that ""desertion"" by the one of the other is complete whoever might have given the initial cause because all the three elements that generally go to constitute ""desertion"" namely, the factum of separation, the animus deserendi, i.e., the intention to live apart and the animus non-revertendi, i.e., the intention not to revert to the matrimonial home stare at the face. Being thus satisfied as to the existence of a ground justifying divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act, we should not and do not have any hesitation to direct recording of the compromise and to decree divorce in accordance with such compromise and we direct accordingly. We have noted that a learned single Judge of the Delhi High Court (Punjab and Haryana High Court) in Davinder v. Loveleen, (1982) 2 DMC 5 and also a learned single Judge of the Bombay High Court in Sudhakarv. Sulabha, (1986) 1 DMC 336 also adopted such a course; but while the learned Delhi (Punj and Har High Court) Judge has not given any reasons therefor the learned Bombay Judge, while spelling out some reasons, has not adverted to the various aspects which we have considered here.",['21']

The argument is no doubt, attractive, but if examined closely it is devoid of substance. What is contemplated in Section 18 (3) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act is the right of a Hindu wife to separate residence and maintenance from her husband. Section 23 of the said Act deals with the quantum of maintenance which a Hindu wife can claim. The residence and maintenance envisaged in Sections 18 and 23 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act are quite different from the maintenance under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. We can conceive of cases where an order for judicial separation was the result of single act of infidelity on the part of the wife. Thereafter there was nothing against her conduct. Is it possible for us to assume that Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act was not intended to benefit such a person? We do not think so. That the obiect of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is to provide for the payment of maintenance even after the dissolution of a marriage is clear. In those circumstances, Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is wider in its scope and ambit than Section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. Further it is not obligatory under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act to grant maintenance as is required by Section 23 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act.

From the judgment of the First Appellate Judge, it is seen that the First Appellate Court allowed the appeal on the ground that appellant ought to have filed application under Section 25 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, holding that when the appellant did not claim permanent alimony or maintenance in the H.M.O.P. when the same was pending, she is not entitled to claim enhancement of maintenance under Section 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, subsequent to decree of divorce, as relationship of husband and wife ceased on the decree of divorce being granted. The learned Judge also held that since no order was passed under Section 25 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act for pemanent alimony and maintenance, the appellant cannot seek for enhancement of maintenance under Section 25 (2) of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.S.A.No.11 of 2016 Hindu Marriage Act. The reason given by the Appellate Court is erroneous.",['25']
48,"The appellant has filed H.M.O.P.No.26 of 2012 under Section 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act for enhancement of maintenance on the ground that already, a sum of Rs.1,000/- is granted to her under provisions of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.S.A.No.11 of 2016 Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. On misconception, the appellant has filed H.M.O.P.No.26 of 2012 under Section 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, claiming enhancement of maintenance. A party can claim maintenance under the Hindu Marriage Act as well as under Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. In the present case, under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, the Court can consider the claim of party, namely wife herein, for claim of maintenance under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, even after disposal of H.M.O.P. for divorce. While granting maintenance under provisions of one Act, the Court has to take into consideration the maintenance already granted under the provisions of other Act and grant proper maintenance under the Hindu Marriage Act. The appellant has filed H.M.O.P.No.26 of 2012 under Section 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, on misconception in view of maintenance already granted under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. The Court has discretionary power to convert H.M.O.P filed under Section 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act to Section 25 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. A Division Bench of this Court, in the judgment dated 19.03.2021 made in C.M.A.No.1167 of 2017, relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant, in the facts and circumstances of the case, converted the proceedings filed under Section 25 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.S.A.No.11 of 2016 (1) to 25 (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act and modified the compensation awarded by the Trial Court. In an appropriate cases, in the interest of justice, the Court can convert the wrong provision to correct provision and pass orders. In the present case, it is not in dispute that the respondent is working as a P.G. Assistant Teacher and was earning a sum of Rs.30,000/- per month at the time of filing of H.M.O.P. Due to passage of time and increase of salary granted by the authorities, the respondent will be getting more than Rs.30,000/- per month now. The respondent has not alleged and proved that appellant is having any independent income to maintain herself without support of t",['25']
49,"The first submission of Mr. Pendse learned counsel for the appellant, was that Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act merely confers a remedy but does not confer any right and hence to obtain an order for permanent alimony respondent No. 1 must establish her right under some other provision of law. It was pointed out by Mr. Pendse that neither under the customary Hindu Law nor under the Act of 1956 can it be said that respondent No. 1 has any right, as the marriage between her and the appellant was null and void and hence she cannot take advantage of the remedy granted by Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In my view, this submission of Mr. Pendse must be rejected. In the first place, on a plain construction of the language used in sub-section (1) of the Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act it is clear that a description is granted to the Court exercising jurisdiction under the Act at the time of passing any decree or thereafter, on application made to t either by the wife or the husband, to order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant such sum for her or his maintenance as set out therein. This power conferred upon the Court clearly creates a corresponding right in the wife or the husband to get maintenance provided the conditions laid down for the grant of the same are satisfied. It cannot, therefore, be said that Section 25(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act does not create any right at all. Secondly, it must be appreciated that a plain reading of this provision shows that it clearly contemplates that not only the wife but even the husband would in certain circumstance be entitled to get maintenance. Neither under the customary Hindu Law nor under the Act of 1956 is any right of maintenance given to the husband at all. Hence. if the submission of Mr. Pendse is accepted, it would mean that the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, in so far as they deal with the claim of the husband for maintenance, would be redundant; and such a construction should not normally be resorted to. Thirdly, it must be remembered that the Hindu Marriage Act is a codifying Act. It is well settled that the object of codification of a particular branch of law is that on any matter specifically dealt with by it, the law should be sought for in the codifying enactment itself. In view of this, the better construction of sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act seems to be that not only does it provide for a remedy but it also confers a right Finally, it must be remembered that the Act of 1956 came into force after the Hindu Marriage Act and hence it could not have been the object of Section 25(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act of create a remedy for the enforcement of a right subsequently created by the Act of 1956.",['25']
50,"The next submission of Mr. Pendse was that if the provisions of sub-section (1) of S. 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act are so construed as to entitle persons, who do not enjoy the status of a husband or wife, to get maintenance, such a construction would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act of 1956 and in particular Section 18 thereof. It was pointed out by him that the Act of 1956 is a subsequent piece of legislation and under the provisions of Section 4(b) thereof any other law in force immediately before the commencement of that Act ceased to apply to Hindus in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in that Act. It was urged by Mr. Pendse that under Section 18 of the Act of 1956 the right to claim maintenance was given only to a lawfully wedded Hindu wife, and hence if a wider right is given by sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the provisions thereof would be inconsistent with the provisions of Section 18 of the Act of 1956. In my view, there is no inconsistency between the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act and those of Section 18 of the Act of 1956. Assuming that on a true construction of Section 18 of the Act of 1956 a right is conferred only on a lawfully married Hindu wife to claim maintenance, it does not follow that the provisions of another statute where by parties to a Hindu marriage even other than a lawfully wedded Hindu wife are granted rights of maintenance would be inconsistent therewith. Moreover, it is not as if a wider construction of Section 25(1) of the said Act of 1955 would render the provisions of Section 18 of the Act of 1956 redundant. Under sub-section (1) of Section 18 of the Act of 1956 of Hindu wife is entitled to claim maintenance from her husband even without filing any petition for nullity or divorce or judicial separation or restitution of conjugal rights. Whereas there is nothing either in the provisions of Section 24 or Section 25 of the said Act of 1955 which confers any such right. This submission of Mr. Pendse must also be rejected.",['25' '4' '18']
51,"In support of his contention Mr. Pendse relied on the decision of a Division Bench of the Madras High court in Narayanaswami v. Padmanabhan, . The question there related directly to the provision of Section 4(1) of the Madras Hindu (Bigamy Prevention and divorce) Act, 1949, with which I am not concerned here. There are, however observation in this decision to the effect that Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act cannot be construed in such a manner as to hold that notwithstanding the nullity of the marriage the wire reliant her status for purposes of applying for alimony and maintenance. In the first place, these observations are admittedly obiter. The provisions of Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act were not before the Madras High Court for consideration nor were they considered in any detail. This appears clear from the observations to the effect that the proper construction; of Section 25 would be that were a marriage was admittedly a nulity, that section would have no application; but where the question of nullity is in issue and is contentious, the Court has to proceed on the assumption until the contrary is proved that the applicant was the wife. With respect, Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with the stage at which a decree has been passed by a Court exercising jurisdiction under that Act or subsequent there to. Assuming that the question whether the marriage was a nulity or not might have been contentious before the decree was passed, once the decree was passed, it would no longer the contentious question. Hence, with great respect , one fails to see the relevance of the above mentioned observation in construing the provisions of Section 25(1) of the said Act. This is only to show that the provision of this subsection never came up directly for construction before the Madras High Court in this case, I may make it clear that with respect, I am unable to agree with the observation of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court which I have referred to above. ON the other hand. I find that the view, which I have taken has also been taken by a Single Judge of the Punjab High Court in Dayal Singh v. Bhajan Kaur, , where it has been observed that the Hindu Marriage Act has not been very carefully drafted and that the language of Section 25 has to be liberally construed.",['25']
52,"While incorporating these provisions in the Act, the Legislature always wanted to secure the interest of female spouse by liberally using the word ""husband"" or ""wife"". Otherwise, the very purpose of providing shelter to a woman will be defeated. The Legislature in its wisdom, if wanted to defeat the rights of a woman who has secured a decree under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, could conveniently say that ""any decree other than the decree obtained under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act"". The moment the proceedings are launched under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, by a husband or by a wife in order to get the maintenance even after the passing of the decree, Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act will come into play as I will presently try to show.",['25']
53,"In fact, their Lordships never said that in such a -circumstance the petition under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act is not legally maintainable or that she cannot file the application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.

With that decree, still, she has the right to file an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In this case the maintenance and litigation expenses, which have been granted to the respondent, cannot be held to be on the excessive side. Therefore, I find this revision without any merit and dismiss the same with costs, which are assessed at Rs. 500/-.",['11' '24' '25']

56,It is an appeal where wife has challenged the decree of divorce. Since the wife is agreed for an alimony under Section 25 in appeal No. 27 of 2016 and the same has been enhanced from Rs. 14.00 lakh which was settled in the agreement dated 15.03.2015 and the same has been enhanced to Rs. 18.00 lakh.

57,"We will take up for consideration the point pertaining to the jurisdiction of the Family Court to entertain these petitions. Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act, under which orders were passed by the City Civil Judge, Bombay, giving custody of minor Varun to Usha reads as hereunder : In any proceeding under this Act, the Court may, from time to time, pass such interim orders and make such provisions in the decree as it may deem just and proper with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of minor children, consistently with their wishes, wherever possible and may, after the decree upon aplication by petition for the purpose, make from time to time, all such orders and provisions with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of such children as might have been made by such decree or interim orders in case the proceedings for obtaining such decree were still pending, and the Court may also from time to time revoke, suspend or vary any such orders and provisions previously made.",['26']
58,"It may be noticed that Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act makes provision for obtaining orders from the Court in which any proceeding under the said Act had been initiated, even after the decree with respect to the custody, maintenance, etc. of the children and the Court is bound to inquire into the said matter as if the proceedings for obtaining such decree were still pending. It may be noticed that it is not the case of any of the parties that the learned City Civil Judge, Bombay, had made any provision for custody of the child even after the death of Usha. If that has not been done and if still during the minority of Varun, Usha has died, the said Court could make appropriate orders regarding custody of the child even after the death of Usha, as if the proceedings for obtaining the decree were still pending. The later portion of Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act enables the said Court before whom the proceeding was pending earlier, to make such orders and provision with respect to the custody of the child even subsequently and therefore, it cannot be said that the said Court cannot give the relief to the parties subsequent to the death of Usha. If the Court before which the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act for dissolution of the marriage were initiated has the jurisdiction even after the decree, to give appropriate directions regarding the custody of the minor child whether it is before or after the death of Usha, having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court as also S. 4 of Hindu Marriage Act it has to be held that the appropriate provisions of the Guardians and Wards Act are inconsistent with Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act in such a situation and therefore, the remedy under the Guardians and Wards Act is unavailable to the parties in such a context.",['26']
59,"It was urged on behalf of the father respondent that before the Family Court no plea regarding lack of jurisdiction had been taken by the grand-parents and on the other hand, they had in fact moved the Family Court for appointing them as guardians and it has been raised for the first time before this Court and in view of the Decision of the Supreme Court in PATHUMMA AND ORS. v. KUNTALAN KUTTY AND ORS., AIR 1982 SC 1683 it is not open to the grand- parents to take such a contention and the same deserves to be repelled. It may be noticed that the Supreme Court in this Decision was concerned with the aspect relating to Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure which in turn refers to the objection as to the place of suing and the said Section appears immediately after Section 20 wherein there is a choice for the plaintiff to institute the suit in more than one Court coming within the purview of Sub-clauses (a) (b) and (c). It is in that connection that when objection was taken to the territorial jurisdiction of the Court for the first time in appeal, it was pointed out that all the three conditions mentioned under Section 21 CPC, must co-exist and only in such a case the objection as to the place of suing could be entertained by the Court of appeal or revision. This is not a case where the objection relating to Family Court is being taken on the ground of place of suing. The objection is on account of the fact that there was already an order passed by the learned City Civil Judge, Bombay, in the proceeding initiated before him under the Hindu Marriage. Act by the parents of the minor child and in that proceeding an order had been passed as provided under Section 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act and therefore, for any further alteration in that regard the parties and to approach only the learned City Civil Judge, Bombay and that the remedy under the provisions of the Guardians and Wards Act is unavailable to the parties in such a context. If that be so, then neither Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure nor the Decision pressed into service by the learned Advocate for the father could be of any assistance to hold that the Family.

60,"In her written statement in the main lis, the wife-respondent made a prayer for return of certain articles specified in the schedule thereto, but the trial Judge having decreed the husband's petition for restitution of conjugal rights, did not make any order in respect of that prayer. The Division Bench on appeal, after allowing the appeal and decreeing divorce, remanded the case of the wife for return of the articles to the trial Court for fresh adjudication under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act on the evidence on record and on further evidence to be adduced by the parties, but made it clear that it was expressing ""no opinion whether or not the claim of the appellant in respect of the items of property or ornaments mentioned in the Schedule to her written statement can be entertained under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act.""",['27']
61,"In this case, however, even if we hold that the articles directed to be returned by the impugned order are not properties belonging jointly to the husband and the wife and accordingly are not properties covered by Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act, nothing would prevent us from recording a compromise to the effect that the wife-respondent has agreed to receive and has in fact received Rs. 15,000/- in lieu of those articles belonging to her in full and final settlement of her claim for return of those articles. For, even if those articles do not come within the ambit of Section 27 or any other provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and are not, therefore, matters which can relate to matrimonial proceedings under the Act, a compromise can still be struck in respect thereof between the parties under the provisions of Rule 5 of Order 23 of the Civil P.C. as they now stand after the Amendment of 1976. Rule 3, as it stood before the Amendment of 1976, provided that the Court on recording an agreement, satisfaction or compromise ""shall pass a decree in accordance therewith so far as it relates to the suit"". The words ""as it relates to the suit"" have now been substituted by the words ""so far as it relates to the parties to the suit, whether or not the subject matter of the agreement, compromise or satisfaction is the same, as the subject matter of the suit."" Therefore, under Rule 3, as it now stands, a Court can pass a decree in accordance with the agreement, satisfaction or compromise between the parties even though the same relates to or covers matters which may not form the subject matter of the suit provided they relate to the parties to the suit and the terms of such a decree would now be executable and are not to be enforced by a separate suit, as was the position prior to the Amendment of 1976. Therefore, even if the articles in question were or could not stricto sensu be the subject matter of a matrimonial proceeding Under the Hindu Marriage Act, as they nevertheless relate to the parties to the proceeding, we would direct recording of the compromise as prayed for. The appeal, therefore, which, as noted hereinbefore, has already ended in a decree for divorce in favour of the respondent-wife against the appellant-husband, shall now stand fully disposed of in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement, compromise and satisfaction as recorded in the joint petition filed by the parties, which shall thus form part of the decree.

62,"All the High Courts are unanimous in regard to the scope of Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Law says that court is entitled to invoke its powers only if the property belongs jointly to husband and wife. The High Courts of Allahabad, Madhya Pradesh and Bombay, and in the earlier decision the High Court of Delhi, in Anju Bhargava v. Rajesh Bhargava (1986) 2 Hindu L.R. 393, have also taken the view that even if the property belongs to one of the spouses, even though Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act may not apply, invoking Section 151 read with Order 7, Rule 7, C.P.C., relief could be granted and the spouse retaining the property as such can be directed to return the same.",['27']
63,"In Shukla v. Brij Bhushan A.I.R. 1982 Del. 223, the learned Judge did not follow the Allahabad decision referred to. It was held in paragraph 2 of the judgment that Section 27, Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is a substantive provision empowering the court in any proceeding under the said Act to make a just and proper order regarding property presented at or about the time of the marriage of the parties and belonging to both of them jointly. It was further held that the remedy lay before the Civil Courts. The scope of Section 151, C.P.C. was not considered in that case.",['27']
64,"On going by the various decisions, I agree with the conclusion arrived by the Allahabad, Bombay and Madhya Pradesh High Courts wherein their Lordships have held that under Section 151, C.P.C. the court can give necessary direction regarding the disposal of the property belonging to individual spouses and the same is within the jurisdiction of the Matrimonial Court. Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act is not a bar, nor does it restrict the power of the Matrimonial court in regard to disposal of the individual properties of the spouses. Merely because a specific provision has been made under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act regarding joint properties of the spouses, it should not be construed that the court has no power or the Court's power is excluded from giving necessary directions with regard to the individual properties.",['27']
65,"It would appear from the above that though there is a conflict of authority on the point as to whether an appeal is competent under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act against orders made under Sections 24, 25 and other similar sections of the Hindu Marriage Act, the preponderance of view as expressed by the Punjab, Calcutta, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Madras High Courts is that such an appeal is competent. After giving the matter my earnest consideration I agree with the above view because the effect of taking an opposite view would be that no appeal would be maintainable even against the decrees granted in proceedings under Sections 9 to 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Those decrees would not answer to the definition of the term ""decree"" as given in the Code of Civil Procedure. Decrees under that Code are granted in regular suits, instituted by the filing of plaints and not by the filing of petitions. The language of Section 28 also makes it clear that decrees under the Hindu Marriage Act are not decrees under the Code of Civil Procedure, for it is stated therein that decrees under the Hindu Marriage Act shall be enforced in like manner as decrees of a Court on its original civil jurisdiction. This necessarily implies that though the decrees under the Act are by a statutory fiction treated for the purpose of enforcement as decrees under the Code, they in fact are not such decrees. It was also not the intention of the Legislature in my view while giving a right of appeal under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, to make that right indefinite and more or less illusory by providing that the appeal under that section would be competent only if a provision for that purpose exists in some other law in force for the time being and not otherwise. Section 28 should be regarded as self-contained so far as appeals against decrees and orders under the different provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act are concerned and for this purpose it should not be necessary to look to other laws. The words in Section 28 ""and may be appealed from under any law for the time being in force"", as I read that section, have reference only to the forum of appeal and the procedure to govern such appeals.",['28']
66,"I, therefore, agree with the view that the orders under Sections 24, 25 and other similar sections of the Hindu Marriage Act are appealable under Section 28 of the Act. This would not, however, solve our difficulty in the present case because the question with which we are concerned is whether an order made on an application under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure in proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act is appealable under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In this connection I am of the view that the appeals contemplated by Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act are against the decrees and orders made under the specified provisions of that Act. Where, however an order is made on an application under the Code of Civil Procedure and not on an application under some provision of the Hindu Marriage Act even though it be in the course of proceedings under that Act, the question as to whether the order is appealable or not would have to be answered by reference to the provisions of the Code. The reason for that is that Section 21 of the Act makes the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to the proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act and if an application is made during the course of those proceedings under the Code it is to that Code that we shall have to look to determine as to whether the order made under the Code is appealable or not. It is not the effect of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act that even though an order on an application under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure be not appealable, an appeal against it would be competent if it is made in the course of proceedings under that Act The only effect of Section 28, in my view, is to give a right of appeal to an aggrieved party against decrees and orders for which an express provision is made under the Hindu Marriage Act, and it would not be a correct construction of the section to hold that it enlarges the right of appeal and makes appeals competent even against those orders under the Code of Civil Procedure which are otherwise not appealable. No authority has been cited at the bar in support of the view that an order, not made under some express provision of the Hindu Marriage Act but on an application made under the Code of Civil Procedure in proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, would be appealable even though the Code gives no right of appeal against such an order. On the contrary I find that there are authorities which fortify me in the view I am taking of the matter.",['28']
67,"There are a number of authorities in support of the view we are taking, but we have so long been considering the question on principles as, in our view, and this we say with due respect, none of the aforesaid authorities has considered the question in such depth or details as we have had to do here in this case, and, in particular, the question does not appear to have been considered in any of those decisions with proper advertence to the Long Tide and in the context of the various other provisions of the Limitation Act To start with, the Full Bench decision of this Court in Debi Bhaduri v. Kumarjib Bhaduri, cannot be taken to have decided the question because the question which concerned and was decided by the Full Bench was whether the shorter period of limitation prescribed by Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, as amended by the Amendment Act, 1976, would apply to any appeal arising out of a proceeding pending on the date of the commencement of the aforesaid amendment Act The Full Bench answered the question in the affirmative and as a result the appeal in that case was to be taken to have been filed beyond the period of Limitation. It was in that context that the Full Bench, while returning the case back to the Division Bench which made the reference, observed (at paragraphs 17 and 22) that the appeal being thus barred by limitation, an application for extension under Section 5 of the Limitation Act was to be dealt with and disposed of by the Division Bench and that the decision of the Full Bench on the question of limitation ""would not affect or prejudice the rights, if any, of the appellant to make an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act"". This is, therefore, obviously no decision or declaration of law on the question as to whether the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act would apply to matrimonial appeals under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act in view of Section 29(3) of the Limitation Act.",['5' '28']
68,"Mr. Sawant, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner husband raised only one contention. He submitted that the marriage of the respondent with the petitioner is null and void in view of the provisions of section 5 read with section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, and such a marriage, therefore, cannot confer the status of wife on the respondent which would entitle her to make an application for maintenance under section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He submitted that in order that a woman may be entitled to claim maintenance under the said provisions, she must satisfy the conditions laid down in that section, one of the conditions being that she is the wife of the person against whom maintenance is claimed. According to him, the word ""wife"" in section 125 must mean, and has all along been construed to mean under section 488 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure, ""a legally wedded wife"", and as such a woman whose marriage contravenes the provisions of section 5 read with section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act being void cannot claim the status of a wife. The mere fact that the necessary ceremonies of a marriage under the customary Hindu Law have been gone into cannot confer on her the status of ""a legally wedded wife' which is a condition precedent for claiming maintenance under section 125 of the Code.",['11' '5']

The different expressions used in these two provisions cannot go unnoticed. So far as Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act is concerned, the marriage is not annulled and is only declared as void by a decree of nullity. Thus, what is done by the court is only a declaration and not annulment of marriage. But, under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, since the marriage is not void ab initio, the same requires to be annulled by a decree of nullity. Here, it is not declaration but a positive act of annulment of the marriage by a decree of nullity. Similarly, under Section 3 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act also, the court annuls the marriage by a decree of nullity. Thus, Section 12 (1) of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 3(1) of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act are in pari materia. Therefore, unless there is a positive decree passed by the competent court annulling the child marriage, the marriage shall be subsisting.",['11' '12']

It is a matter of record that the petition filed by the petitioner under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act against the respondent to annul their marriage by a decree of nullity on the ground that the respondent is impotent was allowed and a decree of nullity of the said marriage to that effect was passed. The said decree also became final as the respondent did not question the same in the Higher Forum. Therefore, the fact that remains established in this case is that the said marriage was annulled by a decree of nullity passed by a competent court of law under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground that the respondent is impotent.",['12']

If the term ""fraud"" is to be interpreted according to the definition given in the Indian Contract Act, then it would become impossible to maintain the sanctity of the marriage. All sorts of misrepresentations will be alleged by the petitioners in order to break the marriage tie. This obviously could not be the intention of the legislature. In Anath Nath De v. Lajjabati Devi, also, the case was under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and S. Datta, J., who delivered the judgment, has observed at page 779 that the marriage according to Hindu law not being a contract, the consent at the stage of negotiations though obtained by fraud cannot affect the validity of the marriage. It is true that in that case no fraud was alleged at the time of the solemnization of the marriage and, therefore, the petitioner could not be granted any relief. But at the same time, the case was decided on the footing that even under the Hindu Marriage Act, the marriage is a sacrament and not a civil contract. My attention is also drawn to the provisions of Section 19 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869.",['12']
72,"In the instant case, the appellant husband was married to the respondent wife on 22nd June, 1985, according to Hindu rites. On account of differences between them, they took a decision to obtain a decree of mutual divorce, which resulted in the filing of a joint petition for divorce under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, (hereinafter referred to as `the Act') on 4th September, 2004, in the District Court at Chhindwara. The same was registered as Civil Suit No.167-A of 2004. As required under the provisions of Section 13-B of the aforesaid Act, the learned Second Additional District Judge, Chhindwara, fixed the date for consideration of the petition after six months so as to give the parties time to reconsider their decision. On 7th March, 2005, after the expiry of six months, the learned Second Additional District Judge, Chhindwara, took up the matter in the presence of both the parties who were present in the Court. While the appellant husband reiterated his earlier stand that a decree of mutual divorce should be passed on account of the fact that it was not possible for the parties to live together, on behalf of the respondent wife it was submitted that despite serious differences which had arisen between them, she did not want the marriage ties to be dissolved. On account of withdrawal of consent by the respondent wife, the learned Judge dismissed the joint petition under Section 13-B of the Act.",[' 13B']
73,"In Prabir Chandra Chatterjee case (supra), a matrimonial proceeding was initiated by the wife by a petition of divorce of her marriage with her husband on various grounds like cruelty, adultery, etc. The petition for divorce was labelled as one both under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act and Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act and the reason for the same appeared to be that the marriage between the parties were first solemnized according to Hindu rites under the Hindu Marriage Act and was thereafter registered as well under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act. Their Lordships of the Calcutta High Court held that if the marriage of the wife with the husband, though celebrated and solemnized according to Hindu rites, was thereafter duly registered under Chapter III of the Special Marriage Act, the ongoing matrimonial proceeding should be governed by Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act and not by Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. And in that case, labelling the petition under Section 27 of the Special Marriage Act as one ""under Section 13, Hindu Marriage Act"" also was useless surplusage, which, at any rate, could not affect the maintainability or merit of the petition for divorce, nor the jurisdiction of the Court to grant divorce, if any case, therefore, was eventually made out at the trial.",['13']
74,"We have already pointed out that the respondent husband had presented his petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act within a period of little more than six months from the date of marriage. On 3rd March, 1976 their marriage took place and the following day the petitioner and the respondent wife had come to the former's residence at 47, Rajani Mukherjee Lane, Behala. The petitioner had pleaded that on 5th March, 1976 when the Boubhat ceremony was performed it appeared that Smritikatna had mental infirmity. According to the petitioner, she was found completely of unsound mind and became extremely aggressive and violent in nature. As already staled, that the alleged particulars of such mental disorder of the respondent were sought to be given by amending the petition under Section 13 of the Act. The petitioner husband claimed that on 11th March, 1976. Dr. A. Chakraborty, a psychiatrist, had examined her and had prescribed medicines. But she had continued to suffer from mental disorder. On 14th April, 1977 the husband got his wife Smritikana examined by Dr. D. N. Nandi, who was described as an eminent psychologist. According to the petitioner, as his relations were left with no peace by us wife, he had hired a flat at Tollygunge Circular Road and took her there on 19th of April, 1976. On 27th May, 1976, the petitioner's father-in-law had visited him and she had abused him and he had fainted and had to be removed to a hospital. Being unable to bear, the husband claimed to have sent his wife to his father-in-law's house, on 11th July, 1976 on return from his office, the petitioner found the respondent in the house. She continued to abuse and misbehave. With the help of Sri Madan Mondal, the petitioner got her admitted in the Hospital for Mental Diseases at Gobra on 14th of July, 1976. While she was still an indoor patient in the said hospital, on 21st Sept., 1976 the present husband had filed the petition under Section 12 and in the alternative under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. As already stated, he did not either plead or prove his exceptional hardship or depravity on the part of his wife. His original petition did not give particulars of the alleged mental illness of his wife, Smritikana. No doubt, he had filed his petition for amendment after expiry of more than one year from the date of the marriage. But he did not thereby plead or thereafter prove by evidence that even after expiry of the period of one year, the respondent wife had continued to be either incurably of unsound mind or that she was still suffering from mental disorder of such a kind and such an extent that the petitioner could not be reasonably expected to live with the respondent. The petitioner had amended his petition by only giving particulars of her alleged mental disorder between 4th of March, 1976 and 14th of July, 1976. He did not even wait for completion of his wife's treatment in the Hospital for Mental Diseases, Gobra.",['13']
75,"From the abovequoted order dated 30.11.1991 it does not appear that while disposing of the application under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act the Court had regard to the question whether there was a reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of one year from the date of marriage. However, it appears from the records that lateron attempts were made for reconciliation but proved futile. Admittedly the husband filed a petition for divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 on the ground that the wife has, after the solemnisation of the marriage, treated the husband with cruelty.",['14']

Suman, decided on 15.12.2009 and then in the case of Ms.Urvashi Sibal & Anr. Vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi, decided on 7.1.2010. Hon'ble Ms. Justice Aruna Suresh referred to Pooja Gupta's case (Supra), and after placing reliance on the two judgments of the Apex Court in Smt. Sureshta Devi Vs. Om Prakash (1991) 2 SCC 25 and Anil Kumar Jain Vs. Maya Jain (2009) 10 SCC 415, took a view that under no circumstance, Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act can be invoked in the proceedings initiated under Section 13(B) of the Hindu Marriage Act. Hon'ble Ms. Justice Aruna Suresh also found that the Apex Court decision in the case of Smt. Sureshta Devi (Supra) was not brought to the notice of the learned Judge during the course of hearing in Pooja Gupta's case (Supra) and therefore, the said judgment ignoring the decision of the Apex Court would have no binding effect.",['14' ' 13B']
77,"Mr. Basu's more formidable contention is that Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act, in view of its Section 29(4), has no application to a marriage under the Special Marriage Act. Elaborating his arguments. Mr. Basu contended that the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act are complete codes in themselves, containing elaborate provisions regarding conditions of marriage, respective rights of parties as also judicial processes in connection therewith. It would not be permissible to import provisions of one statute to the other and in fact by Section 29(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act it is provided that nothing in the said Act shall affect the provisions in the Special Marriage Act with respect to marriages between Hindus solemnised under that Act If Section 15 of Hindu Marriage Act had thus no application, the marriage could not be impugned in law. Mr. Mitra has disputed the above contentions as, according to him, the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act shall, under its Section 29(4). affect only the provisions of marriage under the Special Marriage Act and nothing beyond,",['15']
78,"However, Mr.Pramod Swarup, the learned counsel for the appellant-husband, vehemently submitted that having regard to the fact that both the parties have drifted from married life the marriage must be taken as irretrievably broken, more so because the husband has remarried and has a child through the second marriage and, therefore, this Court should grant a divorce. We do not think that in the facts and circumstances of the case such a view can be taken. From the very beginning the wife has been saying that she is ready and willing to live with the husband. It is the husband who is denying her access. If the husband remarried in hot haste after the institution of the second appeal which was delayed by only three days, we cannot see how that fact can come to his rescue. That is clearly opposed to Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act which in terms states that when a marriage is dissolved by a decree of divorce and there is no right of appeal against the decree or where there is such a right, the time for filing an appeal has expired or an appeal has been presented and has been dismissed, it shall be lawful for either party to the marriage to remarry. In the instant case no doubt the second appeal was delayed by three days but the fact is that it was instituted and was pending on the date of the second marriage. Therefore, the husband acted in disregard of Section 15 and cannot get the benefit of his own wrong""",['15']
79,"Hanmanta v. Dhondavvabai, is a single judge decision of the Bombay High Court. The facts of that decision are very peculiar. There, the legitimate son filed a suit for partition against the father and the father claimed that his illegitimate son born to the second wife, with whom his marriage is void, is also entitled to a share. In such a context, the court held that in spite of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, a child of a void marriage is riot entitled to a share in property of which father is a coparcener. This decision does not discuss either the textual Hindu law or the decisions which dealt with the rights of the illegitimate son of Sudra. The court did not also indicate whether by virtue of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act (unamended Section 16), the illegitimate son got any rights to the property. With utmost respect to the learned judge, we are unable to follow this decision for two reasons: (1) the court did not consider the effect of Section 16 on the rights of an illegitimate son. It did not go into the question whether the status of legitimate son conferred by Section 16 has enlarged his rights; (2) the decision makes observations which are contrary to the principles laid down in Gur Narain v. Gur Tahal Das, (supra) and Ajit Kumar v. Ujayar Singh, (supra).",['16']
80,"Sri Krishna Bhat, learned Counsel for the appellants submitted that even though the marriage of the 1st defendant with the 2nd defendant had taken place in 1967 after the coming into force of the Hindu Marriage Act and as per the amendment effected to Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'), by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Central Act 68 of 1976), even if the marriage of the 2nd defendant with the 1st defendant is held to be null and void, the issues born out of such wed-lock are legitimate issues and are entitled to a share in the property of the joint family of which the 1st defendant is a member. In support of this submission, learned Counsel has placed reliance on a decision of the High Court of Madras in MARGABANDHU AND ANR. v. KOTHANDARAMA MANDHIRI AND ORS 1983(2) Madras Law Journal 445. On the contrary, it is submitted by Sri T.S. Ramachandra, learned Counsel for the respondents 1 to 4 and 6 that the decision in Margabandhu's case has not noticed the specific words contained in Sub-section (3) of Section 16 of the Act which are to the effect that no rights are conferred upon any child born out of a marriage which is null and void or which is annulled under Section 12 of the Act in or to the property of any person other than the parents. Therefore, it is contended that no right is conferred upon such child, in the coparcenary property in as much as coparcenary property cannot be held to be the exclusive property of the parents until the partition takes place between them and the legitimate sons and a particular specific property of the joint family is allotted to their share. Learned Counsel, however, submitted that they are entitled to a share only in the separate and self-acquired property of their parents and not in the coparcenary property. In support of this submission, learned Counsel has placed reliance on a Division Bench decision of the High Court of Bombay in SHANTARAM TUKARAM PATIL AND ANR. v. SMT. DAGUBAI TUKARAM PATIL AND ORS.",['16']
81,"It would thus be seen that the Court would take cognizance of an offence punishable under Chapter XX of the Code only upon a complaint made by any of the persons specified in this Section . According to Clause (c) of the Proviso to Sub-section (1), a complaint for the offence under Section 494 or 495 can be made by the wife or on her behalf by her father, mother, brother, sister, son or daughter or by her father's or mother's brother or sister. Such complaint may also be filed, with the leave of the Court, by any other person related to the wife by blood, marriage or adoption. If a Hindu wife files a complaint for the offence under Section 494 on the ground that during the subsistence of the marriage, her husband had married a second wife under some other religion after converting to that religion, the offence of bigamy pleaded by her would have to be investigated and tried in accordance with the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. It is under this Act that it has to be seen whether the husband, who was married a second wife, has committed the offence of bigamy or not. Since under the Hindu Marriage Act, a bigamous marriage is prohibited and has been constituted as an offence under Section 17 of the Act, any marriage solemnized by the husband during the subsistence of that marriage, in spite of his conversion to another religion, would be an offence triable under Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act read with Section 494 IPC. Since taking of cognizance of the offence under Section 494 is limited to the complaints made by the persons specified in Section 198 of the CrPC, it is obvious that the person making the complaint would have to be decided in terms of the personal law applicable to the complainant and the respondent (accused) as mere conversion does not dissolve the marriage automatically and they continue to be ""husband and wife"".",['17']
82,"It was thus pointed out by this Court that Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act requires that the marriage must be properly solemnized in the sense that the necessary ceremonies required by law or by custom must be duly performed. Once these ceremonies are proved to have been performed the marriage become properly solemnized and if contracted while the first marriage is still subsisting the provisions of Section 494 will apply automatically. In a decision of this Court in Kanwal Ram & Ors. v. The Himachal Pradesh Administration the earlier case was noticed by the Court and relied upon. The matter has also been fully discussed in Priya Bala Ghosh v. Suresh Chandra Ghosh. In view of the authorities of this Court, therefore, the following position emerges: where a spouse contracts a second marriage while the first marriage is still subsisting the spouse would be guilty of bigamy under Section 494 if it is proved that the second marriage was a valid one in the sense that the necessary ceremonies required by law or by custom have been actually performed. The voidness of the marriage under Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act is in fact one of the essential ingredients of Section 494 because the second marriage will become void only because of the provisions of Section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act. In these circumstances, therefore, we are unable to accept the contention of Mr. Mulla that the second marriage being void Section 494 will have no application. It was next contended by Mr. Mulla that there is no legal evidence to show that the second marriage which is said to be a nata marriage was actually performed. We are afraid, we are unable to go into this question because three courts have concurrently found as a fact that the parties were governed by custom of nata marriage and the two essential ceremonies of this marriage are:",['17']
83,"While considering the claim of the appellant for maintenance, though the application filed therefor was under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act 1956, the question framed by the Family court for consideration was ""Whether the second wife can legally claim any maintenance amount under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 or under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. "" It then noted that the appellant was unable to cite any authority to justify the claim of second wife and answered the question without any further discussion stating that ""the legal position is almost settled that since the second marriage during subsistence of first one is void, the second wife does not get any rights as regards the maintenance. As a result, I hold that the respondent being the second wife of the petitioner is not *5* FCA-117/2006 entitled to any maintenance allowance.""
